CoD4X18_Client
==============

A client side only modification and patch for the game Call of Duty 4!!! {CURRENTLY NOT MAINTAINED}

Well as cod4 development has been stopped by infinityward I thought to develop it further because of it's current popularity. So, I started to develop a modification and patch for both client and server version under GNU Affero General Public License. I am developing the version 1.8 as version 1.7 has lastly been developed by infinityward.


In this repository we are developing the CoD4X 1.8 Client Edition. At first we try to fix only annoying bugs and exploits. Later features getting added. This includes also features like modifying asset count restrictions. Also an automatic installation on the client system is planned in order to make them compatible with new server versions which aren't made yet.

If you find any bugs, please create an issue here on github.
